# Security

This is an independent, community-built Azure DevOps extension. It is not affiliated with or supported by HashiCorp or Microsoft.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/sethbacon/azure-pipelines-packer/security/advisories/new) instead. This keeps the report confidential until a fix is available.

When reporting, please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code if available
- The affected version(s) or commit range
- Any suggested mitigations you are aware of

You can expect an acknowledgement within a few business days. Fixes will be released as patch versions and documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Supported Versions

Only the latest published release receives security fixes. If you are running an older version, please upgrade before reporting.

## Credential handling

This extension injects cloud credentials as environment variables (never as CLI arguments) and clears every tracked variable in a `finally` block after each command. Secret values are registered with the agent's secret masker. Temporary credential files (OIDC tokens, GCP credential JSON, OCI/vSphere key material) are written with restrictive permissions and removed during cleanup. If you discover a case where a secret is logged, persisted, or leaked, please report it via the private advisory link above.

## Preferred Languages

English preferred.
